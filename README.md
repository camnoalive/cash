# cash$ (Cams Shell) Created 10/22/2022
Cash$ is a simple esoteric console app revamping windows cmd or bash. Cash is currently in development so lots of things wont work.

As of now CashCore (V1) is only available

Cash V1 will only be the core of Cash$, aka CashCore. This means there will not be many or any features included in Cash$ V1. CashCore (Cash$ V1) will be the
only version of Cash$ that is open source.

Cash$ V2 will include many developer specific tools, and maybe some things the community wants me to add.

Cash$ V2 is now out!! This is just a pre-release, with a few easter eggs, based on CashCore (V1.1)
