# Cash$

Cash is a simple esoteric console app revamping windows cmd or bash.
Cash is currently in development so lots of things wont work.


Usage:
  
  Windows:
    Download the cash.exe file and place it in desired location.
    Run the exe
   
  Linux:
    Download the main.py file and navigate to the directory the file was downloaded to. Then open your terminal and run the python file like so `python cash.py`

Features possibly coming in V1.1:

1. Different font colors

2. Automatically adding Cash$ to windows path

3. Access to all windows and linux commands

4. More custom and Cash$ specific commands
