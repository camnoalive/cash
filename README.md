# cash (Cams Shell)
Cash is a simple esoteric console app revamping windows cmd or bash. Cash is currently in development so lots of things wont work.

As of now Cash$-Core (V1) is only available

Cash V1 will only be the core of Cash$, aka CashCore. This means there will not be many or any features included in Cash$ V1. CashCore (Cash$ V1) will be the
only version of Cash$ that is open source.

Cash$ V2 will include many developer specific tools, and maybe some things the community wants me to add.
