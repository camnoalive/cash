# cash$ (Cams Shell) Created 10/22/2022
Cash$ is a simple esoteric console app revamping windows cmd or bash. Cash is currently in development so lots of things wont work.


Cash V1 will only be the core of Cash$, aka CashCore. This means there will not be many or any features included in Cash$ V1. CashCore (Cash$ V1) will be the only version of Cash$ that is open source, for now.

Cash$ V2 will include developer specific tools/commands, and maybe some things the community wants me to add.

Cash$ V2 (v2.1 Bruno) is out!
