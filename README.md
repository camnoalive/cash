# cash$ (Cams Shell) Created 10/22/2022
Cash$ is a simple esoteric console app revamping windows cmd or bash. Cash is currently in development so lots of things wont work.



Cash$ V2 is out!!

Download V2 here:
https://github.com/cmarshalldev/cash/releases/tag/v2.1

Right now support for linux doesnt exist. but hopefully i can add linux support. the new v2 update, i estimate to come out on new years. with all the time in between i hope to perfect the terminal for other fellow devs.
